**CV Page**
This repository contains a CV (Curriculum Vitae) web page created using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework. Below is an explanation of the key features and components used in the project:

**Features**
**1. Bootstrap CDN Integration**
The project includes Bootstrap by linking the Bootstrap CDN in the <head> section of the HTML file, which provides access to its grid system, components, and utility classes.

**2. Responsive Layout (Grid System)**
The Bootstrap grid system (e.g., container, row, col-md, col-lg) was used to ensure the page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
The use of responsive classes like col-md-6 and col-lg-4 ensures optimal layout on both medium and large devices.

**3. Components for Sections**
Header: The header section was built using Bootstrap typography utilities like h1, h2, and text-muted to display the name, profession, and tagline.
About Me: This section includes a brief bio, styled using Bootstrap text utilities (lead, text-center) for alignment and emphasis.
Skills Section: Bootstrap progress bars and/or cards were used to visually represent different skill levels.
Experience & Education Sections: These sections utilized list groups or cards to display work and education history with details like job titles and descriptions.
Projects/Portfolio: The grid system was again employed here to display project cards or images, with each project described briefly and linked.
Contact Form: A contact form was built using Bootstrap’s form components, including input fields for the name, email, and message, styled with classes like form-control.

**4. Styling with Bootstrap**
The project relies on Bootstrap’s built-in classes for consistent and clean styling. No custom CSS was written.
Typography: Headings, paragraphs, and muted text were styled using classes like lead, text-muted, and display-4.
Buttons: The contact form uses Bootstrap buttons (btn-primary, btn-outline-secondary) for submitting forms and other links.

**5. Navigation Bar**
A responsive navbar was included to ensure that the navigation adjusts smoothly across different devices using the navbar-expand-md and navbar-toggler classes.

**6. Interactivity with Components**
The carousel component or card decks were used to showcase projects in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
Icons from Bootstrap Icons or FontAwesome were used to represent skills or contact information (e.g., email, phone, social links).

**7. Accessibility Features**
All images include alt text to improve accessibility.
Buttons and form elements were provided with appropriate aria-labels to enhance usability for screen readers.
